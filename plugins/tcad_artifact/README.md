# TCAD execution plugin

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

The thin research CLI loads the `tcad_execution` execution interface. It freezes
the selected adapter, transport configuration and implementation inputs, then uses
the host's trusted execution gate for side effects. Installation registers the
plugin; it does not contact or qualify a remote solver. See the
[CLI guide](../../docs/ROOTLESS_CLI.zh-CN.md) and
[transport contract](../../docs/tcad_transport_contract.md) for configuration and calls.

Select `tcad_execution:tcad` with an explicit `config_file`; inline TCAD
configuration and implicit deployment defaults are rejected. The plugin file is
a JSON/TOML object with `transport = "command"` and `command_config_path`, or
`transport = "socket"` and `socket_path`. Local paths resolve relative to their
own configuration file. Preparation checks command/SSH schemas, referenced local
files and optional `implementation_compilation.capability_snapshot_path` without
contacting a backend or creating adapter state. Settings freeze with the instance;
editing the top-level plugin file does not amend an existing instance.

This plugin also retains reusable schemas, project materializers, parsers and
Operation declarations. These are [library contracts](../../docs/PLUGIN_RUNTIME_API.md);
they do not provide a Run/Artifact application or an Operation scheduler.
Scientific Workers author solver projects and assess results. Deterministic code
resolves exact source, case anchors, capability, file bindings and resource policy.
It does not invent physical models or generate a solver deck from an underspecified request.

## Execution backend

`tcad_control` manages operational run directories and detached process state. It
provides capability/policy discovery, exact submission lookup, submission, status,
cancellation, inspection and collection. Submission is idempotent for the exact
frozen descriptor. If a response is uncertain, recover the original identity;
unavailable lookup does not authorize another submission.

The accepted `TCADJobSpec` binds an archive descriptor and member manifest, a
deployment-owned tool profile, trusted execution purpose, resource limits and
expected outputs. Job protocol schema version 4 includes `collect_generated_outputs`
and wall, CPU, memory, output and total storage limits. Control and runner must use
compatible protocols. Solver capability snapshots use `tcad.solver-capability.v2`;
private executable paths, environments and fixed arguments remain outside the
public snapshot. Counts and digests bind private settings; public arguments require
administrator opt-in. Changing scientific inputs creates a new implementation and
requires applicable qualification to be established again.

The bounded SSH command transport invokes `remote_runner_py36.py` through an
existing authorized OpenSSH connection. `transfer_chunk_bytes` defaults to 1 MiB.
The application installer and `deploy/reinstall.sh` publish local application code.
Remote runner deployment is a separate administrator action using explicit
configuration and authorization; see `deploy/install_ssh_tcad_runner.sh` at the
repository root. Updating local code does not update a remote protocol.
Examples and installation success grant no execution permission.

## Policy, accounting and recovery

Administrator configuration must supply valid `agent_execution_policy`, `runner`
and `debug` sections. See [policy example](config/execution-policy.example.json) and
[runner example](config/remote-runner.example.json). Missing or invalid policy is
rejected. Example thresholds are configurable values, separate from RAM or transfer
quotas. Policy authorization is bound to the exact request, package, compiled
identity, budget and policy digest; independent review is not an execution decision.
The runner rechecks authorization at submission and freezes resource settings.

Reserve work before submission. Renaming or revising a scientific project does not
create a fresh allowance. Terminal observations settle elapsed wall time and storage
high water; missing observations and unknown submissions retain reservations.
Policy tightening retains prior consumption. A reservation may be released only
upon authoritative permanent non-submission proof for the exact original call and
descriptor, consumed by the original budget owner. An absent lookup result,
cancellation, timeout or unknown state is not such proof. Diagnostic attempts have
their own configured bounds and durable identities.

Total storage includes logical inputs, intermediates, outputs and logs; deleting
inputs does not remove their charge. Retained stdout mirrors are conservatively
included. Runners sample directory size and stop the process group on excess.
Their manifest reports observed high water, sampling interval and overshoot;
this is not an instantaneous peak or filesystem hard quota. Scientific input
staging, archives, transfers and collection stream file bytes. Small JSON and
previews have separate limits. Transfer allowances do not authorize larger jobs.

SDevice grid inputs bind exact scientific file originals and implementation slots;
materialization retains the source bytes and provenance. A cached response alone
is not trusted execution evidence. Recovery must verify original submission and file
identities, preserve accounting, and reconcile the same call before any next action.

## Trust and qualification

The backend owns execution facts; the research controller owns scientific bindings,
budgets and permission decisions. A local domain daemon separates processes and
faults while retaining the same-user trust boundary. Same-user shells may reach
control files, sockets and secrets. See [Security](../../SECURITY.md).

Solver projects declare physical code, inputs, parameters and raw TDR/PLX/PLT/log
outputs. Parsers and curve scoring derive observations and metrics; Workers own
scientific conclusions. Native solver, SSH and scientific-chain qualification must
bind the exact implementation and environment; see
[TCAD qualification](../../docs/TCAD_QUALIFICATION_STATUS.md).
The plugin does not distribute Synopsys executables or licenses.
