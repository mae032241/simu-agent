# Release and qualification scope

## Supported scope

The application provides `scid-research`, `scid-experiment` and an on-demand
instance UI. The research controller uses native scientific threads, explicit
instance roots, frozen inputs and finite budgets. Reusable Operation/compiler
declarations, schemas, callbacks and domain adapters remain library surfaces;
the [Plugin API](PLUGIN_RUNTIME_API.md) identifies their current owners.
[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the [CLI guide](ROOTLESS_CLI.zh-CN.md)
define behavior, permission and recovery boundaries.

Source, HTTP and synthetic-process checks establish only the behavior they exercise.
They do not qualify real native continuation, browsers, TCAD solvers, actual power
loss or cross-host recovery. Workers and same-user host processes are trusted.
[Security](../SECURITY.md) describes that soft boundary; [TCAD qualification](TCAD_QUALIFICATION_STATUS.md)
describes domain limits. A qualification decision applies to exact implementation,
inputs and environment. New code cannot inherit a historical verdict.

## Source publication

`scripts/build_git_release.py` is the explicit source-publication allowlist. It
copies current source, deployment tools, supported plugin trees, functional tests
and fixtures, current reference documents and selected developer tools. It normalizes
text and modes, scans the result, then writes `MANIFEST.sha256` and a deterministic
`.tar.gz` archive. An existing output requires an explicit `--force`; use a fresh
output directory when preserving a candidate.

Plans, audits, stage results, handoffs, superseded specifications and trial outputs
are local records outside long-term tracking and source publication. Functional
fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/` or `scripts/acceptance/fixtures/` and are
published with their consumers. Research databases, credentials, private datasets,
generated platform profiles and local agent instructions are excluded. Bundled
reference manuals have separate distribution restrictions; see [NOTICE](../NOTICE.md).
The release scan and checksum manifest do not establish redistribution rights.

## Checks and preservation

Select checks for the exact diff under the serial supervisor in
[tests/README.md](../tests/README.md). The explicit source-release check is
`tests/installation/check_source_release.py`; it checks files, references and the
manifest without installing the application or running the packaged functional
suite. Wheel packaging and installed entry points require their own selected
checks when affected. A source archive does not prove wheel completeness.

Run model, browser and solver checks only with their own scope, environment and
budget. Sampled RSS/time stops do not provide kernel-enforced aggregate isolation.
Keep verification evidence bound to the exact candidate and retain unverified
boundaries. Do not combine passing counts across revisions into whole-suite qualification.

See [installation](INSTALL.md) for publication, rollback and removal boundaries.
Frozen implementations retain their identities; uncertain submissions require
same-call reconciliation. Restore never resets consumed budgets or replaces
external effects with an earlier ledger snapshot.
